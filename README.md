# Gypsy Spellweaver

I'm a old-school programmer who has never stopped learning and doing. This is where I place my projects related to my activities on the Stack Exchange network. 

## My Projects

The current projects are:

- `challenge-linked-list`
  - In response to a comment on a Q&A site I wrote a quick piece to sort a linked list in C++.
- `comment_removal`
  - As an answer to a question on a Q&A site I wrote a piece of Regular Expression to remove comments from a program's source code. (Now moved to my "professional" account on GitHub.)
